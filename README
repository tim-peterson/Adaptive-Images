Description of changes from Matt's original Adaptive-Images repo:

1) split adaptive-images.php into 2 files: one for generating images, generateImage.php, and another for serving images, serveImage.php


2) in .htaccess, change file to handle all images from adaptive-images.php -> serveImage.php
i.e., change:

    RewriteRule \.(?:jpe?g|gif|png)$ Adaptive-Images/adaptive-images.php
to this:

    RewriteRule \.(?:jpe?g|gif|png)$ Adaptive-Images/serveImage.php


3) Goal of generateImage.php:

The goal of generateImage.php is to take a file like this:

    $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'].'/Adaptive-images/01.png'

 and largely using the ````generateImage()```` function and resizes it and renames it like this:

    $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'].'/Adaptive-images/small01.png'

In my case, I will call ````generateImage()```` 4 times to generate 4 separate images one for each of the 4 major device screen widths: 1280, 992, 768, 480. 


4) Goal of serveImage.php:

If you go to http://localhost/Adaptive-images/demo.html, there is an <img> tag like this:

    <img src="01.png">

The point is for your server to recognize that the request is an image (based on ```RewriteRule \.(?:jpe?g|gif|png)$ Adaptive-Images/serveImage.php````) and to go to serveImage.php to figure out what to do with the image. ````serveImage.php```` creates/uses the ````$_COOKIE['resolution']```` and then ````sendImage()```` is called to serve the file with the path modified or not based on the value of the screen ````resolution````.
